      <b>Project Overview</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
        Save On Foods is among many grocery stores that provide online shopping as an option to their customers. With many competitors, the need to show users the savings and deals that Save On Foods has to offer is imperative to company success. This is the need we chose to focus on when conducting this UX research study.    </p>

      Our primary goals were to:
    </p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>Gauge the discoverability/visibility of the deals tab and all the sub pages that are available to their use, in order to save money on their grocery orders. </li>
      <li>Understand how much time is spent to find an item using the “Deals” page vs using the “Shop Aisles” page. We want to assess the learnability and efficiency of each page and whether or not one is easier to access than the other</li>

      <b>The Process</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      We followed the double diamond UX process for this case study to define the problem clearly in order to produce the best solution for our users.The four stages of the double diamond process are Discovery, Definition, Development, and Delivery. These stages are a roadmap that designers use to organize the creative process when improving user experience.

      <b>User Interviews</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
        Our user interviews were conducted in two parts: an observation of them performing a task, followed by a semi-structured interview. We wanted to compare the ease of finding an item under the “Shop Aisles” tab compared to finding an item under the “Deals” tab, and we did this by timing how long it took participants to find the same item using different pages, as well as recording the screen and tallying the number of clicks used.
    </p>

    <img src="pictures\grocery1.png" class="images">
    <p class="lead" id="para">
        For the semi-structured interview, we gathered qualitative data by asking about their experience, and quantitative data about which “Deals” subcategory they used the most. The data was gathered using coding sheets, then sorted using an affinity diagram.

    <p class="lead" id="para">After gathering the data, we generated personas off our statistical knowledge that represent certain types of users that are the audience of our solution. This allows us to fine-tune our design for our target users.  </p>

    <p class="lead" id="para">The findings from the interviews are what we would use to help prototype the improved design. </p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>The interface’s strength is the “Shop Aisles” page, as it took on average 29.6 seconds faster to find an item there compared to the “Deals” page</li>
      <li>The interface’s weakness was the “Deals” page, which took on average 10 clicks to find an item, compared to 6 clicks using the “Shop Aisles” page</li>
      <li>The filter function was broken on some of the pages, with the letters only going up to “c”</li>

      <b>Design Requirements</b>

    <p class="lead" id="para"> The user interview results combined with the user personas we created allow for a comprehensive list of design requirements ready for implementation</p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>The system must have a complete list of filters on the side of the “All Specials” page.</li>
      <li>The system must have the regular price displayed next to the deal price. </li>
      <li>The system must be accessible for users via the internet (both mobile and desktop).</li>
      <li>The system should remove the ads at the top of its “Save on, Savers” page.</li>
      <li>The system could make the titles of the deals pages more intuitive.</li>
