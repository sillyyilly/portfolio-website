      <b>Project Overview</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      Yelp is a popular platform that people use to find restaurant information such as availability, reviews, menus, and more. This is a UX research case study that aims to understand important features for users when searching for restaurants using Yelp. This information can be used in future designs to improve users' experience with the interface.

      Our primary goals were to:

    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>Understand which features are important for helping users make decisions to visit a certain restaurant</li>
      <li>Examine how frequently “Yelp Search Results” truly assists in recommending excellent restaurants that are worth visiting, or not visiting</li>

      <b>The Process</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      We followed the double diamond UX process for this case study to define the problem clearly in order to produce the best solution for our users. The four stages of the double diamond process are Discovery, Definition, Development, and Delivery. These stages are a roadmap that designers use to organize the creative process when improving user experience.

    <p class="lead" id="title"> <i>The Discover Phase</i> </p>

    <p class="lead" id="title">
      <b>Research Methods Used</b>
    </p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>Surveys</li>
      <li>Semi-stuctured interviews</li>
      <li>Direct observation</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead" id="title">
      <b>User Interviews</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      Our discovery was conducted through three parts. First, we asked participants to complete a questionnaire asking about what they feel is important when searching for a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      The second part was a multi-step interview where participants were shown various images, then interviewed. Participants were first shown pictures of a restaurant on Yelp and asked what features were important to them deciding whether to visit the restaurant or not. Then, participants were shown the whole Yelp page including specific reviews, and asked whether their decision changed after seeing the reviews and why.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      The third part was a direct observation semi-structured interview where participants were given a set of preferences, then asked to find a restaurant using the Yelp interface considering the preferences they were given. They were asked to narrate their thoughts as they completed the task, and their actions were screen recorded for review. Once the task was completed, they were asked questions about their experience with the interface.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">
      Coding sheets were used in all interviews to organize the qualitative data.

      <b>Methods Used</b>
    </p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>Affinity Diagrams</li>
      <li>User personas</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead" id="title">
      <b>User Personas</b>

    <p class="lead" id="para">After gathering the data, we analyzed our quantitative data, and created an affinity diagram from the qualitative data that we got from our coding sheets.</p>

    <div class="mt-4"></div>
    <p class="lead" id="para"> From all this information, we generated personas representing certain types of users who are the audience of our solution. This allows us to fine-tune our design for our target users. </p>

    <p class="lead" id="title">
      <b>Results for prototyping</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para">The findings from the interviews are what we would use to help prototype the improved design. </p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>The UI of Yelp’s Search and Filter Features made the searching process difficult to navigate. Users cited too many options, and found it slow.</li>
      <li>⅔ of people don’t click to a second page before making their decision</li>
      <li>The most important features of Yelp for users are: Images, Review Score, and Cost.</li>
      <li>Users relied on total number of reviews more than content of reviews themselves</li>
      <li>The obtrusiveness of sponsored posts made users distrustful of Yelp, which lowered their trust in Yelp’s recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead" id="title">
      <b>Design Requirements</b>
    </p>
    <p class="lead" id="para"> The user interview results combined with the user personas we created allow for a comprehensive list of design requirements ready for implementation</p>
    <ul class="lead" id="list">
      <li>Viewing the menu is extremely important for users’ diet restrictions, preferences and budget. These criteria can instantly remove a restaurant as a viable option for users, so users should be able to locate the menu on the interface quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>Users should be able to see the total number of reviews as well as some highlighted reviews on the first page of each restaurant </li>
      <li>Images should be easy to find and should be easy for users to submit to upload.</li>
    </ul>
